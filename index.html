            <p>I joined this class to persue a career in Web Development and hopefully parlay those skills in to the field of blockchain technologies. 
                I know this won't be easy, but I am determined to succeed so I can get out of my warehouse job and have a more secure future.

                When I'm not studying or at work I enjoy hiking Blue Hills, riding my bike around Wompatuck State Park, and DJing on my Traktor s8 controller. Since class has started I haven't had much time to DJ, but once I find a job as developer I plan to dive right back in.
